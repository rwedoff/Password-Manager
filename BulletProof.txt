Consider Feature Changes:

0. run from command line - ask Omar about our implementation and whether he's okay with the 0,1,2,3,4 input. Otherwise....
1. Pass integrity check on the first round: currently, it doesn't check the integrity of anything on the first round because nothing

---- Reason, we don't save until after we exit the loop; we already have pulled the data so an attacker will never be able to enter data except through the proper input channel

2. Input takes other commands that are not ints
3. Add a catch all for ! and spaces in pretty much everything
4. Should the hash be output to the command line like that? I commented it out.
5. As of now, our program outputs a zero when we successfully enter the MasterPassword


ADVANCED FEATURES:
0. Alllow users to back out of registering/changing an account












Master Password is encrypted using SHA512 Hash, the key for the AES using the PKCS etc. 12 with a SHA 512 Digest()

AES Blocks, CTR mode


Integrity from SHA512 HMAC; SHA512 Digest
